# 👋 Hey, I’m **Pierrick Van Hoecke**

I’m a **Cloud Engineer** and **AI & Data Science student** passionate about technology, creativity, and personal growth.  
Over the past two years, I’ve gained hands-on experience working at **Cegeka (formerly DexMach)**, supporting and securing hybrid cloud environments for large companies.  
That experience taught me to **learn by doing**, think in **solutions rather than problems**, and stay precise and reliable in everything I do.  

Now, I’m expanding my path toward **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**, where I combine my cloud background with a drive to build intelligent, automated, and meaningful projects.

## 💡 What I’m Currently Working On
- Expanding my skills in **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Engineering**  
- Building small **AI automation projects** that connect **Azure** and **data**  
- Exploring how **AI** can enhance creativity and **music production**

## 🧠 Tech Stack
`Microsoft Azure` · `Python` · `Terraform` · `GitHub` · `PowerShell` · `Bash` · `Microsoft Defender for Cloud` · `Data Science (in progress)`

## 🌱 What I Believe In
I believe growth happens through **curiosity, consistency, and hands-on learning**.  
Technology isn’t just about systems or data — it’s about **creating impact**, **solving problems**, and sometimes even **making something that sounds good** 🎶

## 🎵 Outside of Tech
When I’m not studying or building, I’m producing **Jump-Up Drum & Bass**, spending time at the gym, or exploring new ideas to push myself further — both creatively and personally.
